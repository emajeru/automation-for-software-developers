What is automation?
**The Google** tells us that:
> Automation is the technology by which a process or procedure is performed with minimal human assistance

I don't necessarily like that definition because while true, it diminishes entirely what is actually happening. Automation is a way for a human to structure a process in their mind and frame it so that a computer or some other machine is able to understand it. It's us speaking directly to the machine and it letting us know it understands. I say understands because if it doesn't it will sure as shit let you know.

Throughout the talk, I'm going to go over a few techonologies that vary in complexity to accomplish the same or simlar results. I will preface this by saying that this is in **Not at all** the only way to accomplish these tasks. There are methods galore but it is a nice introduction or a fun distraction (depending on your level) to add some automation to your day and maybe even workflow.
